# Learning
The Rexx programming language, when compared to similar languages such as Perl, Tcl, and Python, is very easy to learn. This is due to its simple syntax, English-like instructions, and minimalist nature.

An abundance of Rexx learning resources exist, but these mostly target Rexx on the mainframe, and are typically more focused on interfacing to platform features than on exploring Rexx language features in any depth. This is a typical example: [REXX Tutorial - IBM Mainframer](https://www.ibmmainframer.com/rexx-tutorial/#main). Interesting, but probably not an ideal resource for the non-mainframe, Rexx learner.

A more useful, beginner-friendly, Rexx learning resource is [Rexx Tutorial - Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rexx/index.htm). It is useful as a quick reference such as how to perform loops, or to lookup up built-in function use. However it can be confusing because it covers several non-applicable features, and various Rexx implementations.

## Recommended Tutorial
In the author's opinion, the most useful, and entertaining, Rexx tutorial is Jeff Glatt's, [Learn REXX Programming in 56,479 Easy Steps](http://nokix.sourceforge.net/help/learn_rexx/language.htm). It not only provides an overview of the language, but explores various features intuitively, and in some depth. Useful, too, as a reference tool. Highly recommended to learners of all skill levels.

## Recommended Reference
Since this track uses the [Regina](https://regina-rexx.sourceforge.io/index.html) implementation of Rexx, the most appropriate reference is the accompanying documentation. While it may be found in the `docs` folder of the Regina distribution, it may also be downloaded directly from [Regina Documentation](https://sourceforge.net/projects/regina-rexx/files/regina-documentation/3.9.5/regina.pdf).
