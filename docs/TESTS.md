# Tests

## Preamble

One approach to solving Exercism exercises is to access the website, and use the in-browser IDE where you can edit and test your solution. Alternatively, the exercises may be downloaded to your local computer where you use your own editor, and tools, to create, test, and finally submit, your solution.
