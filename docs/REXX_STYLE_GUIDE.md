# Rexx Style Guide

This guide describes the style intended for use with the Rexx track exercise test, and example, files.

## Rexx Standard

Code should conform to Rexx Language level 5.0.

Regina Rexx extensions, and SAA Standard functions for external library access, may be used.

AREXX extensions, and CMS buffer manipulation routines, should not be used.

## Platform

The runtime test environment is Linux-based, therefore only commands available in that environment may be used in ADDRESS instruction invocations. These should be clearly highlighted in code commentary.
